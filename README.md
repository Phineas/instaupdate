Update your name, location, URL, descriptions (bios), banners and much more on every website at once.

## Usage
You need to change and add all the details of your accounts in the [config.js](data/config.js) file.

Next, you will need to change your profile details in the [profile.js](data/profile.js) file.

Once you are done, you can simply use ``node index.js`` and the script will do everything for you!
